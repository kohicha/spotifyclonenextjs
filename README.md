## Spotify Clone

This is just a fun project learning about nextjs, I'm planning to make this full stack but without the music feature. For now I'll be focusing on the frontend and learn more about routing. Hit me up with a DM if you have any questions or even give some advice on how to improve this! 

Kaoruko enjoyer :P

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

## To be continued

I am currently having some trouble running nextjs on my computer even after some modifications on the program and the libraries, so this project will be set on hold, and I'll switch back to react.js just to further understand the fundamentals of the react hooks. 

Next.js was my first framework and I loved it very much. I'll return.
